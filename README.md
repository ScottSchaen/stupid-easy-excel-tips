## Make Excel (and Windows) snappier by disabling animations
Windows adds some subtle animations to Excel (and other applications). You may not be able to put your finger on it, but it makes everything feel slower. Disabling these animations instantly makes Excel feel snappier. 

#### Disable worksheet animations
Selecting cells and scrolling through cells are “animated”. You may not realize, but this feature is slowing you down. You’ll never look back after disabling it.

<kbd>WIN</kbd> → Search for `Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows`. Uncheck `Animate Controls and elements inside windows`.

#### Disable animations when minimizing and maximizing windows
This is less of an Excel improvement and an overall Windows improvement. Like above, it’s subtle and will make your computer feel faster without it. Don't worry about _smoothness_, Windows will still be plenty smooth.

## Opening Excel should take you to a new spreadsheet, not the welcome splash screen
It’s personal preference, but chances are when you open Excel you want to get straight to business with a fresh spreadsheet. If you're frequently opening recent files, you may want to leave it as is. 

Welcome Start Screen | Straight-to-business Worksheet

![Open to Excel Splash](/images/welcome_splash.png)[]() | ![Open to Worksheet](/images/new_sheet.png)[]()

File → Options → Uncheck “Show the Start screen when this application starts”


## Make the Quick Access Toolbar useful.
By default, you’re multiple clicks away from opening files, creating new files, or printing. That's not right! Add all of these features and more to the quick access toolbar, which will always be there for you.

Hit the dropdown in the Quick Access toolbar or right click anywhere on the ribbon and click `Customize Quick Access Toolbar`

## Use the Status Bar — Don’t bother with unnecessary formulas
This is one of the biggest tips I have for you if you didn't know about it. The Status Bar on the bottom right of the Excel Window is the easiest and fastest way to summarize data you’ve selected. Enable all of the calculations and immediately you’ll know the min and max values in the selection, the sum, the average, a count of non-empty cells, and a count of numbers. You can select a whole column and you don't need to worry about column headers and empty cells throwing off your data.

Right click anywhere on the status bar. Enable everything you want.

## Customize the Home Ribbon — Load it up with only useful functions
